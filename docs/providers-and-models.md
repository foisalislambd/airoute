# Providers and models

A provider is an account you already have: OpenAI, Anthropic, a gateway, a local server, and so on. A model is one entry under that provider. AIRoute does not sell model access. It forwards a call after you save the provider's key and turn the model on.

## Turn a model on

1. Open **Providers** in the panel.
2. Open the provider.
3. Save its API key. Use **Test** when the page offers it.
4. Turn the model on.

Until those steps are done, a client that asks for the model gets an error.

## More than one account

A provider can hold several accounts. On the provider page, add each key or session cookie under **Accounts**, then turn the ones you want on.

**Account order** decides which one is called first:

| Order | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| Fill first | The lowest priority number is used until that call fails. The next enabled account is tried in the same request. |
| Round robin | Calls spread across the enabled accounts. The one used least recently goes first. |

Priority `0` is first in fill-first order. A new account is added after the ones you already have. If the provider is on and it needs a key, the last remaining account cannot be removed until you turn the provider off.

## Model ids

Clients always use a public id:

```text
provider-slug/upstream-id
```

Examples:

| Public id | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `openai/gpt-4o-mini` | OpenAI's GPT-4o mini |
| `anthropic/claude-...` | that Claude model, if it is in the catalog and turned on |

The slug is the last part of the provider page address, `/providers/openai`. The upstream id is the name the provider itself uses. The panel shows both. AIRoute strips the slug before it calls the provider.

## Empty lists

A lot of OpenAI-compatible providers ship with no models until you press **Load models**. That button downloads the provider's list and stores it.

Load models replaces the list for that provider. If you already curated which models are on, loading again starts from the provider's list.

## Base URL

Most providers have a base URL in the catalog. A few do not, because there is no single public host to assume. The provider page leaves the field empty. Paste the base URL from that provider's own docs, then save.

A wrong base URL shows up as a connection error in **Activity**.

## Kinds of model

| Kind | How you call it |
| --- | --- |
| Chat | `POST /v1/chat/completions`, or Cursor |
| Image | `POST /v1/images/generations` |
| Video | `POST /v1/videos/generations` |
| Decision | `POST /v1/systemone`, not chat |

Chat is the path Cursor uses. The other kinds are in the [API](api.md) and [Decisions](decisions.md) guides. If you send a decision model to chat, the router tells you to use `POST /v1/systemone`.

Some providers are listed but marked unsupported. Those rows are there so you can see them. They do not complete a chat call.

## Fallback

**Fallback** is a named chain of chat models. The public id looks like `fallback/your-name`. If the first model fails, AIRoute tries the next.

Every step in a fallback has to be an OpenAI-style chat model. Image, video, and decision models cannot sit in the chain. The panel will say so if you add one.

Create the chain on the Fallback page, turn it on the same way you think about any other model, and pass `fallback/your-name` as the model id from the client.
